## Problem Statement
PhoneNow’s Call Centre Manager, Claire, requires a clear, data-driven overview of call centre performance trends to enhance operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. The goal is to build a Power BI dashboard that visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) and provides actionable insights into customer and agent behavior.

Key Findings:  
1. **Call Handling Performance:**  
   - **81.08% of calls were answered**, while **18.92% were abandoned**.  
   - **72.92% of calls were resolved**, leaving **27.08% unresolved**.  
   - The **average speed of answer (SOA) is 67.52 seconds**, which may indicate inefficiencies.  

2. **Customer Satisfaction:**  
   - The **average satisfaction rating is 3.40 out of 5**, suggesting room for improvement.  
   - Agent satisfaction scores are relatively consistent, ranging between **3.33 and 3.47**.

3. **Agent Performance:**
   - **Dan handled the most calls (523), followed by Becky (517)**.  
   - **Greg had the highest number of resolved calls (455 out of 502 answered)**.  
   - Agents’ **average speed of answer varies significantly**, highlighting possible inefficiencies.
